# Python Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my Python learning projects - practical scripts developed while mastering Python programming. Each project focuses on solving specific tasks while demonstrating good coding practices and Python functionality.

## Projects

### 1. Secure Password Generator
A customizable password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user specifications.

**Features:**
- Configurable password length and quantity
- Optional character sets:
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Special characters (!#$%&*+-=?@^_.)
- Interactive command-line interface
- Multiple password generation in one run

**Usage:**
```bash
python password_generator.py
```
Then follow the interactive prompts to configure your password requirements.

### 2. Caesar Cipher Tool
An implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm for encryption and decryption of text.

**Features:**

- Supports both encryption and decryption modes
- Works with Russian and English alphabets
- Customizable shift value
- Case-sensitive processing
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters
- Interactive user interface

**Usage:**
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```
Follow the prompts to select operation mode, language, shift value, and input text.

## Learning Objectives
- Through these projects, I'm exploring:
- Python input/output operations
- String manipulation
- Character encoding
- Random number generation
- Modular code organization
- User interface design
- Error handling (in future versions)
